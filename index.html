            <h2>1) The Profile That Didn’t Blink 📱🌑</h2>
            <p>I was bored, scrolling my own name—Hurm Fuse, Delhi—late at night. That’s when I saw it.</p>
            <p>An Instagram profile. Same name. Same city. Same face—but older. Tired. Empty bio. No followers. No following.</p>
            <p>Last photo posted two hours ago. It was my room. Not a mirror. Not a selfie. The angle… from the corner near the door. The one spot I never stand in.</p>
            <p>Next day, I got a Tor link in my email. From a forum I never joined. They said: <em>“Look closer. You missed something.”</em></p>
            <p>I opened it. A live webcam feed. My room. The chair I always leave empty… someone was sitting in it.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2) Typing… and Waiting 💬🕳️</h2>
            <p>I was chatting with Rhea, a friend from Delhi University, on WhatsApp late at night. Random jokes.</p>
            <p>Then she stopped replying. Typing bubble stayed. Minutes passed.</p>
            <p>I sent a question mark. A message appeared instantly: <em>“Stop looking at it.”</em> Sent from my account.</p>
            <p>Next morning, I found a dark web page with my username as the URL. Nothing else but a blinking cursor.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3) The Call That Found Me 📞🌒</h2>
            <p>I woke up to a missed call from an unknown number. Duration: 0 seconds.</p>
            <p>Later, Aman, my friend from GK-1, Dwarka, texted: <em>“Why did you call me at 4:12 AM?”</em></p>
            <p>I hadn’t. But his phone showed my name. Call duration: 17 seconds.</p>
            <p>That same night, a dark web forum had a post: <em>“He answered before he knew he called.”</em> No username, no comments. Just the sentence and a timestamp: 4:12 AM.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4) The Extra Seconds 🎥🩸</h2>
            <p>I record myself sometimes. Just talking. Practicing.</p>
            <p>One night I stopped recording at 3:02. Closed the app. Went to sleep.</p>
            <p>Weeks later, someone commented on the private video. Quoted something I never said.</p>
            <p>I opened the file. Timeline ends at 3:02. Waveform keeps moving until 3:17. At 2:41, I remembered standing up. The rest… just breathing.</p>
            <p>Dark web archive logs show my video uploaded automatically—to a hidden forum called /livewatch. I never uploaded it.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5) Something Used My Key 🚪🌑</h2>
            <p>Late night, coming back from GK-1, Dwarka. I unlocked the door. Went to bed.</p>
            <p>Next morning, living room off. Chair facing wall. I don’t own that chair.</p>
            <p>Family laughed. But floor beneath it was warm.</p>
            <p>A Tor forum later showed a post: <em>“Chair moved. Subject asleep. Watching still.”</em> Username: HurmFuse.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6) Online Without Me 🟢🕸️</h2>
            <p>Phone says online. I’m holding it. Turn off Wi-Fi, still online. Turn off data, still online. I power it down. Laptop buzzes. Draft message open in WhatsApp Web, chat untouched for months:</p>
            <p><em>“Easier to find like this. Don’t log out.”</em></p>
            <p>Cursor blinks once. Then stops. Dark web logs: my IP appears active on a forum I never accessed. Timestamp matches exactly when my phone went offline.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7) Seen 👁️🖤</h2>
            <p>Opened an old Instagram chat. Neha Sharma, passed last year. Typed “Hey.” Message sent. Second later: Seen. No reply. Chat closed.</p>
            <p>Searched for her. Gone. Dark web page appeared in my history. URL: <em>tor://nehash/seen</em>. Just my last message. Just my name.</p>
